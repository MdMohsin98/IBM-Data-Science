# IBM-Data-Science
This repository contains all the notebooks, practice works and projects done by me during IBM Data Science Course.
This repository contains the 5+ projects that I have worked on that are listed below - 
1. Cancer Detection: Developed a machine learning model to detect cancer using clinical data, performed feature selection and extraction, and evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics.
2. Predicting Economic Trends: Analyzed economic data to identify trends and patterns, and developed a forecasting model using regression techniques to predict future trends.
3. Predicting Customer Churn: Used machine learning algorithms to predict customer loyalty for a telecom company, performed data preprocessing, and evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics.
4. Recommendation Engines: Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering techniques, and evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics.
5. Rain Prediction in Australia: Built a machine learning model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in different locations in Australia using weather data, performed data preprocessing, and evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics.
